          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            Hooking Season is a chaotic couch competitive new take on the twin
            stick shooter gameplay. Players control a holiday-themed character
            and use their hooks as a way to move and eat opponents. Added to
            this, all characters have special abilities.{' '}

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            This project all began back at university when we decided to form a
            game development club in which we decided to work on a Christmas
            themed game entitled "Mall Rush".
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, we have worked on many projects together, but when it
            came time to make our first commercial title, we decided to revisit
            an old favorite.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a lot of work, the game we now know as "Hooking Season" came
            to be.
