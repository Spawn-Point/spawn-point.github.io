            Manage several factories that get more complex and demanding than
            the one before. Make sure you keep as many workers alive as you can
            at the end of the day, while making the most money.

          <p>
            All of the machines in the factories are top of the line regardless
            of what the government or the police say. But just in case make sure
            to keep an eye on the machines when workers are nearby.
